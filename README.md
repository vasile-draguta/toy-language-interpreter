# ToyLanguageInterpreter

``
Disclamer: This project is still ongoing. I'm working and trying to improve it.

## Introduction
This is a project that I am building for my faculty course of Advanced programing methods. It is written in Java.
The main idea of this project is to build a toy language interpreter that can execute a program written in a specific language.
By doing this, I will have a better understanding of how interpreters work and how to build one. 

###### Some features that have been already implemented are:
- Variable declaration
- Variable assignment
- Arithmetic operations
- Logical operations
- If statements
- Print statements

###### Features that I am planning to implement in the future:
- [ ] While loops
- [ ] For loops
- [ ] File operations
- [ ] Threads
- [ ] Creating new processes with fork
- [ ] Heap memory
