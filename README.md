# ToyLanguageInterpreter

## Introduction
This is a project that I am building for my faculty course of Advanced programing methods. It is written in Java.
The main idea of this project is to build a toy language interpreter that can execute a program written in a specific language.
By doing this, I will have a better understanding of how interpreters work and how to build one.
